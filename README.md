# Introduction
This project and the associated files were created as part of a training project. The folder "\_bewertungsgrundlage" therefore contains files on the basis of which this project is evaluated.

All textures, sounds and other things were taken from publicly available sources, for which the author has explicitly expressed his consent for the use and publication.

# For evaluation
In the folder "\_bewertungsgrundlage" you will find all additional files you need for the evaluation. This includes the synopsis in Markdown and PDF form, as well as the evaluation criteria based on the synopsis. There is also a file in the folder called "MÃ¶gliche_Punkteliste_Kopie". This file is a copy of the original scoring basis and was used for my personal progress tracking.
